# User Interface components
Components to find and edit a TrimMainObject (e.g. Record) are available in the SDK.

## Take Care
Each of these methods requires a pointer to a parent window.  It is important to send something meaningful not simply null, which can cause the SDK some confusion.


## Running
To run:
 - download the code
 - copy HP.HPTRIM.SDK.dll to the lib folder
 - if you are running a 32 bit OS select 'Prefer 32-bit' in the project properties
 - run the project

You should see a screen like the one below.
